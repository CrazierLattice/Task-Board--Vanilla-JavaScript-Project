1.Users are required to fill an task and a valid date, filling an hour is Optional.

2.The format of the date is (International Format) Year/Month/Day -- YYYY/MM/DD The reason for choosing the International Format is because the date's interpretation will be different from one country to another hence, the choice for this simple numerical date system that would appeal to & be understandable by a global audience.

3.The tasks are contained inside an array stored in localStorage.

4.Notes are added from left to right, newest will be shown on the left, added a fade-in effect on adding a new task / refreshing the website
